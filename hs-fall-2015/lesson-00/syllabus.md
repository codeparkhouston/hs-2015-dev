# Welcome!

Code Park is a year round after school club for learning to program interactive websites.

Fall 2015, each class will consist of:

1. A video (approximately 10 minutes long) introducing new concepts
    * To be watched in between classes
1. Hands-on projects in class with mentors guiding you

In Spring 2016, we will take on projects from companies and non-profits around Houston and build them.  We aim to help place motivated and advance students in internship opportunities for Summer 2016.

# Expectations

* Everyone is expected to be respectful, curious, and hard working.
* Ask questions when you need help!
* If you need to miss class, please let one of us know ahead of time.
