# First Lesson

# Script is a series of instructions
* recipes
  * specific or more elaborate step-by-step
* handbooks
  * looking up events to know how to respond accordingly
* manuals
  * see current condition
  * respond as appropriate

Code is our way of teaching the computer to do something.
* goal
* design and break down into smaller problems/steps
* code each step
  - tasks
  - steps
  - the codes

- book goes through example of breaking down a project into tasks, then steps, then code
What if we have something similar where each lesson builds pieces of a full project?

How to find the tallest person example.


# Second lesson
A simplified version of codecombat first in class, and then codecombat can be the last part of class and homework?
Khanacademy?
what is debugging



When do we tie things in to HTML and how to do the script tag for example, like on pg. 46

pg. 50 -- SYNTAX breakdown of a method being called.
JavaScript is case-sensitive
pg. 56

"You can compare variables to short-term memory because once you leave the page, the browser will forget any information it holds." -- pg. 58

pg. 60 -- variables diagram

Interesting, they are strict about first declaring then assigning, and then teaching the regular syntax as the shorthand later one.






# Later
pg. 26 -- object type examples
  * properties
  * events
  * methods

Web browser as object

Interesting experimenting to show js runs right where it's loaded.
