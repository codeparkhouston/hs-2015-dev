* Hand out the syllabus, a mysterious challenges list, and a question to answer
* Discuss syllabus
* Discuss roles of humans vs. computers
* Robot Teachers activity
    * Put students in teams to control each of us as robots
    * Have them "program" us to do the following from their list
        * Snack Grab
            * Robot should bring a snack of your choice back to your desk.
        * Door Open or Close
            * Robot should open door if door is closed, or close door if door is open.
        * Board Animal
            * Robot should draw an animal on the whiteboard.
