## Hello,

Thank you so much for joining us in class today.  We learned that:

* Coding is giving instructions to computers
* Being specific helps

As mentioned, here is the [**fun, quick, video-based lesson**](http://codeparkhouston.com/hs-lesson-01/exercise/) for you to do before the next class.

In our next class we will solve a maze using functions.

Be sure to ask us any questions you have in the [Slack chat](https://codepark.slack.com/messages)!

See you next class!
-- Your Code Park teachers
