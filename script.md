# Lesson One

We will start our class by learning JavaScript.  First we will practice using JavaScript right inside of Chrome and move a robot on the screen using code.


<!-- anytime I narrate something, I should also be doing it on screen -->
First, let's open Chrome.  Then, go to [codeparkhouston.github.io/fall-2015/lesson-one](https://codeparkhouston.github.io/fall-2015/lesson-one).

Here, we see a robot on the top left corner.  





<!-- Make some error. -->
Don't worry.  This will happen. This is what's called an error message.  Messages like these give us a clue into what to look for when we want to fix our code, or "debug."






You can just reload the page, like this, and your robot will be back in it's place.
