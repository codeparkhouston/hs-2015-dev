Hi! Just like how we talk about in class, coding a way for us to talk to our computers and give it instructions.  Today, we will give 


## Goals

The goals of this video is to:

* Introduce you to Chrome's `console`
* Practice coding in the `console`
* Learn a little about methods

Let's get started!

First we will practice using JavaScript right inside of Chrome and move a robot on the screen using code.


<!-- anytime I narrate something, I should also be doing it on screen -->
First, let's open Chrome.  Then, go to [codeparkhouston.github.io/fall-2015/lesson-one](https://codeparkhouston.github.io/fall-2015/lesson-one).

Here, we see a robot on the top left corner.  





<!-- Make some error. -->
Don't worry.  This will happen. This is what's called an error message.  Messages like these give us a clue into what to look for when we want to fix our code, or "debug."




# The formula
